## Simple Chart D3

Simple Chart made with html <svg> tag, d3 library, and vanilla JavaScript. I created DUMMY_DATA for this project which displays charts. There is a scaling functions X axis and Y axis. The height and the width had been coded dynamically. A function setTimeout() had been added to explain the importance of .selectAll from d3 library.
